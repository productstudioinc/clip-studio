  text: " Buena Park Police say an internal investigation is now underway. The Orange County Register obtained surveillance video of the incident and in it you will see the man genuinely shocked, confused, and scared when confronted by that off-duty officer. Which are these?  Jose Areola pays for a pack of Mentos, the candy his wife asked him to buy at an Orange County service station. But the simple transaction goes terribly wrong when a man claiming to be an off-duty police officer gets involved. Oh, I think we're in. I pay for it.  Put it back.  Put it back.  With officer.  I just pay for this.  Put it back. I tried stealing that from you. I just paid. Get your cash and leave.  Did he pay for this?  Yeah. Did he pay for this?  Yeah.  He paid for it?  Yeah.  Are you sure? My apologies, sir. My apologies.  Areola says sorry isn't enough,  especially since he can't stop replaying this encounter that happened March 16th.  It made me mad. At the same time, it scared me because I thought this guy can shoot me.  Ariola says he was worried about his wife waiting outside in their car during the incident, not knowing if he would be shot. He also says he has a lot of respect for law enforcement, but having an officer pull a gun on him and wrongly accuse him of stealing a dollar and 19 cent pack of candy  is just taking it too far. Even when he identified himself as a police officer.  He told me, take that out of your pocket.  I complied.  You know, we learn to comply, especially when they're holding a gun at you.  But now I feel disappointed that I was mistreated and harassed when I did nothing wrong.  Areola has hired an attorney and requested financial damages from the Buena Park Police Department. The Buena Park Police Department says because this is an active investigation, they will not be commenting at this time. Hello, I'm Mark Brown.  Click the ABC 7 logo THEIR HOME.  THEIR HOME.",
