**Enhancing Creativity and Copyright Compliance with Randomized Background Videos**

We're thrilled to introduce a new feature to improve your video creation experience: **Randomized Background Videos**. This feature is designed to help you stay creative while ensuring copyright compliance, making your content more engaging and hassle-free. In the near future, we plan to add even more background selections and allow users to upload their own custom backgrounds.

### **New Feature: Randomized Background Videos**

Starting today, your generated videos will include **randomized background videos**—a new approach to elevate creativity while keeping your content compliant with copyright regulations.

#### **Benefits of Randomized Background Videos**

1. **Copyright Compliance**: Randomizing backgrounds helps minimize the risk of copyright issues by preventing repetitive use of the same footage.
2. **Increased Content Variety**: Your videos will look fresh every time, offering **unique visual experiences** to keep your audience engaged.
3. **Broader Appeal**: With more backgrounds, your videos will resonate with a wider variety of audiences, expanding your content's appeal.
4. **Creative Inspiration Boost**: The variety of backgrounds can spark new ideas, allowing you to explore different creative possibilities.
5. **Save Time and Effort**: Automated background selection means less manual work for you—simply focus on creating amazing content while we handle the visuals.

#### **How the Feature Works**

- **Large, Copyright-Compliant Video Library**: Our platform uses an extensive collection of copyright-safe background videos.
- **Automated Background Randomization**: Each time you generate a new video, the system randomly selects a background that best complements your content. When you choose a background video, it selects a segment from a large library of videos, or you can click the "Choose new section" button to choose a new section.
- **Seamless Integration**: The selected background will blend in smoothly, enhancing your video's visual storytelling.

This new feature is part of our commitment to enhancing your **video content creation** process with tools that promote creativity and reduce copyright-related worries.
