We're excited to introduce two new templates that will expand your creative toolkit and offer even more ways to engage your audience.

**New Feature: Fake Text Message Video Template**

Create compelling narrative videos that simulate text message conversations:

- Generate realistic-looking text message threads for storytelling, marketing, or educational content.
- Customize message bubbles, timestamps, and contact names for authenticity.
- Perfect for creating relatable content for social media platforms.

**New Feature: Twitch Stream Clip Template**

Repurpose and highlight the best moments from Twitch streams:

- Easily create short, engaging clips from longer Twitch broadcasts.
- Add captions, reactions, and custom overlays to enhance the viewing experience.
- Ideal for content creators looking to expand their reach across multiple platforms.

**Enhancement: Adjustable Caption Positioning for Text Message Videos**

We've also added more flexibility to our existing text message video feature:

- Now you can adjust the position of captions in your text message videos.
- This allows for better readability and visual appeal, especially when dealing with varying lengths of messages or different screen sizes.
- Experiment with top, bottom, or custom positioning to find what works best for your content.

These new templates and enhancements provide even more ways to create engaging, platform-specific content that resonates with your audience. Whether you're simulating text conversations, highlighting gaming moments, or fine-tuning your existing videos, these tools are designed to help you tell your story more effectively.

We can't wait to see what you create with these new features!
